<b>TASK:</b><br>
Imagine that you have been hired as a data analyst for a company that plans to disrupt the airline industry by building an underground high-speed passenger rail tunnel. The company needs your help to decide which two major United States airports this tunnel should connect. Tâ€‹he distance between the airports must be within a specified range, and the airports must have a large volume of air travelers flying between them in both directions. The company believes that these air travelers can be persuaded to switch to high-speed rail because of frustratingly long flight delays.
You must write a SQL statement and analyze the result to recommend which two airports this rail tunnel should connect.
